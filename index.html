        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Apache HTTP Server (Apache) and Nginx are popular open source web servers. 
            Nginx was developed to serve content faster than Apache with 
            less overhead. But are all types of content served faster with Nginx?
        </p>

        <h2>Experimental Set Up</h2>
        <p>
            Apache HTTP 2.4.53 and Nginx 1.20.0 were installed on 
            an AWS EC2 T2 Micro instance running Amazon Linux 2 x86 Kernel-5.10, SSD. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To test the two web servers for speed in serving different content types, one HTML 
            file of size 206 bytes, one PHP file containing only the phpinfo() function that displays PHP config 
            information, and one JPG of size 35 kbytes were placed in each web server's default root directory
            as testing endpoints.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apache Bench (ab) was run using another AWS EC2 T2 Micro instance running Apache HTTP 2.4.53
            on Amazon Linux 2 Kernel-5.10 as the request generating machine. A total of 10,000 requests
            were sent to each endpoint at a concurrency level of 1000. The generating machine was not 
            a part of the same VPC as the host machine. Requests per second and time to fulfill a request 
            were measured.

            Nginx was faster than Apache in serving static content but Apache handled dynamic content 
            faster as seen in Figure 1. Nginx was able to serve more static file requests per second 
            (Fig. 1a) but took longer to serve dynamic PHP files (Fig. 1b).

            To visualize the passage of time as the concurrent requests were fulfilled, GNUPlot was used 
            to graph cumulative total time taken as requests were completed (Figure 2). For HTML and JPG 
            content NGINX fulfills all 10,000 requests in less total time whereas it takes slightly longer 
            to handle PHP (Fig. 2b).

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            Nginx was able to outperform Apache for static HTML and JPG files. However, for dynamic content
            like PHP it was slightly outperformed by Apache. This was reasonable to expect because Apache embeds 
            dynamic content language processors into each worker instance so it is able to handle dynamic content 
            execution internally. Nginx cannot process dynamic content natively and 
            must use a reverse proxy to hand off the dynamic content processing to an
            external interpretor such as Apache. But this means Nginx does not have the overhead of having the 
            language processor present for static content and is faster when serving static content. However, the
            need to wait for an external processor to handle dynamic pages presents a bottleneck for Nginx.
        </p>
        <p>
            The architecture of each web server extends beyond the presence or lack of a dynamic language processor.
            Nginx is asynchronous, non-blocking, and event-driven while Apache uses an essentially multi-threaded structure.
            Nginx worker processes handles connections by placing them in an event loop similar to how NodeJS handles processes
            and continuouly checking for new events to add to the loop. As events are processed they are removed from the loop.
            Apache users have the capability to configure what processing modules Apache uses but all use the general
            thread-based approach. Apache has the bottleneck of relying on the processing of these threads before new 
            connections can be made and their requests executed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apache also has a distributed configuration system where users can configure the web server for each content
            directory with .htaccess files. When handling a request, Apache has to check for these files in each component of the 
            requested path. Nginx centralizes configuration to the default configuration file. This boosts the performance of Nginx
            over Apache for static file reads because it does not have to search for these .htaccess files and interpret 
            them, it just takes the configurations from the central file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, both web servers have their advantages and disadvantages. Apache comes with a hefty amount of 
            configuration capability and native dynamic content processing whereas Nginx ditches much of the bulk to 
            make static content serving faster but relies on external support for dynamic content handling. One possible 
            tech stack might use Nginx primarily with a reverse proxy connection to an Apache server to handle dynamic 
            content.
